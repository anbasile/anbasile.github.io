      <description>Summary &amp;ldquo;As the machine learning (ML) community continues to accumulate years of experience with live systems, a wide-spread and uncomfortable trend has emerged: developing and deploying ML systems is relatively fast and cheap, but maintaining them over time is difficult and expensive&amp;rdquo;. (Sculley, et al., 2015)
In this talk, we are going to take a look at some problems that arise when we are ready to bring NLP models to production.</description>

      <title>Setting up a server for NLP models in production</title>

      <description>Summary In machine learning, serving a trained model means making it available for people to use it to get predictions from their data and it is a fundamental step of bringing any NLP research outcome to production.
Here we will see how to set up a high-performing inference server capable of running models saved in different formats. We will be using the TensorRT Inference Server (TRTIS from now on), developed by nvidia.</description>
