      <description>Summary &amp;ldquo;As the machine learning (ML) community continues to accumulate years of experience with live systems, a wide-spread and uncomfortable trend has emerged: developing and deploying ML systems is relatively fast and cheap, but maintaining them over time is difficult and expensive&amp;rdquo;. (Sculley, et al., 2015)
In this talk, we are going to take a look at some problems that arise when we are ready to bring NLP models to production.</description>

      <title>Setting up a server for NLP models in production</title>

      <description>Summary In machine learning, serving a trained model means making it available for people to use it to get predictions from their data and it is a fundamental step of bringing any NLP research outcome to production.
Here we will see how to set up a high-performing inference server capable of running models saved in different formats. We will be using the TensorRT Inference Server (TRTIS from now on), developed by nvidia.</description>

      <description>Summary Do you use jupyter notebooks? And virtual environment too, right? And do you know how to use them together? Ah! I got you. It is very simple: follow this guide to learn how to install a custom kernel.
Why? Using virtual environments is important:
  it helps you to maintain your system clean: don&amp;rsquo;t install system-wide libraries that you are only going to use once for a small project</description>

      <title>Un manifesto per i manuali universitari</title>

      <description>Allen Downey Ã¨ docente di informatica presso l&amp;rsquo;Olin College (Needham, Massachusetts - USA) e autore di una fortunata serie di manuali di statistica. Qualche anno fa ha scritto un bel manifesto per i nuovi manuali universitari: lo traduco qui al volo con il permesso dell&amp;rsquo;autore. Qui trovate l&amp;rsquo;originale in inglese.
 Il mio manifesto per i manuali universitari Ã¨ cosÃ¬ semplice da sembrare stupido: gli studenti dovrebbero poterli leggere e capire.</description>

      <description>Please use this form for contacting me, so that those smart crawlers out there don&amp;rsquo;t get to see my email address. However, if you really want and/or you are a really really smart electronic email address crawler, you could maybe combine just two letters, which are used for referring to oneself, with the symbol that you always see in these strings that you are building, together with my name and what usually comes after my name.</description>
